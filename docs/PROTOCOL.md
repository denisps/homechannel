*Complete communication flow showing server registration, keepalive, and client connection establishment.*

## UDP Protocol (Server ↔ Coordinator)

Server initiates UDP connection to coordinator. All messages use binary protocol for minimal fingerprinting and overhead.

### Binary Protocol Format

All UDP messages follow this format:

```
[Version (1 byte)][Type (1 byte)][Payload (variable length)]
```

**Protocol Version**: `0x01`

**Message Types**:
- `0x01` - HELLO (Phase 1: DoS prevention)
- `0x02` - HELLO_ACK (Phase 2: Tag verification, rate-limited)
- `0x03` - ECDH Init (Phase 3 of registration)
- `0x04` - ECDH Response (Phase 4 of registration)
- `0x05` - Registration (Phase 5, encrypted)
- `0x06` - Ping (keepalive)
- `0x07` - Heartbeat (challenge refresh)
- `0x08` - Answer (SDP response)
- `0x09` - Migrate (coordinator migration/failover)
- `0xFF` - ERROR (Rate limiting, not sent for HELLO)

### Five-Phase Registration with DoS Protection

Registration uses a multi-phase approach with tag-based DoS protection before expensive ECDH operations. ECDH key exchange establishes a shared secret before sending any sensitive data. No ECDSA public keys or signatures are transmitted unencrypted.

#### Phase 1: HELLO (Server → Coordinator)

Server sends a random 4-byte tag to initiate the handshake:

```
Binary: [0x01][0x01][Binary Payload]
```

Binary Payload Format:
```
[serverTag(4)]
```

Fields:
- `serverTag` (4 bytes): Random tag generated by server

**Security & DoS Protection**:
- Minimal processing required from coordinator
- **Source IP:port cannot be trusted** at this stage - only used for reply routing
- No expensive cryptographic operations
- No server identity revealed

**Rate Limiting**: Coordinator rate-limits **replies** (HELLO_ACK), not incoming HELLOs, since source IP cannot be trusted. No ERROR responses are sent to HELLOs to prevent amplification attacks.

#### Phase 2: HELLO_ACK (Coordinator → Server)

Coordinator echoes server's tag and adds its own tag:

```
Binary: [0x01][0x02][Binary Payload]
```

Binary Payload Format:
```
[serverTag(4)][coordinatorTag(4)]
```

Fields:
- `serverTag` (4 bytes): Echo of server's tag
- `coordinatorTag` (4 bytes): Random tag generated by coordinator

**Security**: Server verifies its tag to confirm response is for its request. Coordinator's tag will be used in Phase 3 to prevent replay/amplification of expensive ECDH operations. Coordinator does not store server's tag (server will echo it back).

#### Phase 3: ECDH Init (Server → Coordinator)

Server sends ECDH public key along with coordinator's tag:

```
Binary: [0x01][0x03][Binary Payload]
```

Binary Payload Format:
```
[coordinatorTag(4)][ecdhPubKeyLen(1)][ecdhPubKey]
```

Fields:
- `coordinatorTag` (4 bytes): Echo of coordinator's tag from HELLO_ACK
- `ecdhPubKeyLen` (1 byte): Length of ECDH public key (typically 65 bytes for uncompressed P-256)
- `ecdhPubKey` (variable): ECDH public key (raw bytes)

**Security**: Coordinator verifies its tag before performing expensive ECDH operations, preventing DoS amplification. No server identity revealed yet. Observer cannot determine which server is connecting.

#### Phase 4: ECDH Response (Coordinator → Server)

#### Phase 4: ECDH Response (Coordinator → Server)

Coordinator responds with its ECDH public key and encrypted signature:

```
Binary: [0x01][0x04][Binary Payload]
```

Binary Payload Format:
```
[ecdhPubKeyLen(1)][ecdhPubKey][encryptedData]
```

Fields:
- `ecdhPubKeyLen` (1 byte): Length of coordinator's ECDH public key
- `ecdhPubKey` (variable): Coordinator's ECDH public key (raw bytes)
- `encryptedData` (variable): AES-GCM encrypted signature data

Both parties compute ECDH shared secret. Coordinator signs **both ECDH public keys** (coordinator's + server's) with its ECDSA private key to bind them together and prevent MITM attacks. The signature data is encrypted using AES-GCM with key derived from the shared secret:

```javascript
{
  timestamp: 1234567890,
  signature: 'hex-signature-of-both-ecdh-keys'
}
```

Server uses its own ECDH public key (which it already knows) and the coordinator's ECDH public key (received in this message) to verify the signature and confirm coordinator's identity.

**Security**: Coordinator proves its identity and binds both ECDH keys together. Observer cannot impersonate coordinator, perform MITM attack, or see the signature. No redundant transmission of keys.

#### Phase 5: Registration (Server → Coordinator)

Server sends encrypted registration data using AES-GCM with key derived from ECDH shared secret:

```
Binary: [0x01][0x05][AES-GCM Encrypted Payload]
```

Encrypted JSON payload:
```javascript
{
  serverPublicKey: 'pem-key',
  timestamp: 1234567890,
  payload: {
    challenge: 'hex-string',
    challengeAnswerHash: 'hex-string'
  },
  signature: 'ecdsa-hex-signature'
}
```

The signature is computed over the JSON representation of:
```javascript
{
  ecdhKeys: 'hex-concat-of-server-and-coordinator-ecdh-keys',
  serverPublicKey,
  timestamp,
  payload
}
```

By signing both ECDH public keys, the server binds them together. The coordinator verifies this using the session-stored ECDH keys, preventing MITM attacks where an attacker could substitute their own ECDH key. No redundant transmission of keys - coordinator already knows its own ECDH public key.

**Security**: Server identity (ECDSA public key) and challenge data only revealed after encryption established. Both ECDH keys are cryptographically bound via signature. Observer cannot see challenge, identify server, or perform MITM attack. Minimal data transmission.

After registration, the `challengeAnswerHash` (expectedAnswer) becomes the shared secret for all future communication.

### Keepalive Ping (Optimized - No Payload)

Sent every ~30 seconds:

```
Binary: [0x01][0x06]
```

**Optimization**: Ping messages contain no payload and require no encryption/decryption. The coordinator simply updates the server's timestamp upon receiving a ping from a known IP:port. This minimizes CPU usage and network overhead for frequent keepalive messages.

### Challenge Refresh (AES-GCM Encrypted Payload)

Sent every ~10 minutes. AES-GCM provides both encryption and authentication:

```
Binary: [0x01][0x07][Encrypted payload]
```

Encrypted JSON:
```javascript
{
  type: 'heartbeat',
  payload: {
    newChallenge: 'refreshed-challenge-hex',
    challengeAnswerHash: 'new-expected-hash'
  }
}
```

**Security**: AES-GCM authenticated encryption ensures that only the legitimate server (with the correct `expectedAnswer` key) can send valid heartbeat messages. If decryption succeeds, authentication is guaranteed.

### SDP Answer (AES-GCM Encrypted Payload)

Response to client offer:

```
Binary: [0x01][0x08][Encrypted payload]
```

Encrypted JSON:
```javascript
{
  type: 'answer',
  serverPublicKey: 'hex-encoded-ecdsa-public-key',
  sessionId: 'client-session-id',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  payload: {
    sdp: { type: 'answer', sdp: '...' },
    candidates: [
      { candidate: '...', sdpMLineIndex: 0, sdpMid: 'data' },
      // ... all ICE candidates
    ]
  },
  signature: 'hex-encoded-ecdsa-signature'
}
```

### Migrate (AES-GCM Encrypted Payload)

Coordinator requests server to migrate to a different coordinator:

```
Binary: [0x01][0x09][Encrypted payload]
```

Encrypted JSON:
```javascript
{
  type: 'migrate',
  payload: {
    host: 'new-coordinator.example.com',  // or IP address
    port: 3478,
    publicKey: 'hex-encoded-coordinator-ecdsa-public-key'
  }
}
```

**Behavior**: 
- Server receives migration request after AES-GCM key is established
- Server saves failover coordinator info to disk (`failover-coordinator.json`)
- Server immediately attempts to register with new coordinator
- On successful registration, server switches to new coordinator
- Old connection is gracefully closed
- Migration failure does not interrupt current connection

**Use Cases**:
- Load balancing across multiple coordinators
- Coordinator maintenance and upgrades
- Geographic load distribution
- Failover during coordinator issues

### ERROR (No Payload)

Sent by coordinator when client is rate-limited or banned:

```
Binary: [0x01][0xFF]
```

**Purpose**: Notifies client of rate limiting or temporary ban. Client should back off and retry later. No payload needed - message type alone conveys the error.

## HTTPS Protocol (Client ↔ Coordinator)

Client connects via standard HTTPS polling (no WebSockets).

### Get Coordinator Key

```

    candidates: [
      // ... all ICE candidates from server
    ]
  },
  serverSignature: 'server-ecdsa-signature',
  coordinatorSignature: 'coordinator-ecdsa-signature'
}

Response (waiting):
{
  success: false,
  waiting: true,
  coordinatorSignature: 'coordinator-ecdsa-signature'
}
```

## Message Flow

### Server Registration

1. Server generates challenge and expectedAnswer
2. Server sends unencrypted registration to coordinator (ECDSA-signed)
3. Coordinator verifies signature and stores server info
4. Server identified by IP:port for ongoing communication

### Client Connection

1. Client gets server's challenge from coordinator
2. Client computes challenge answer from password
3. Client gathers all ICE candidates
4. Client sends offer + candidates + challenge answer
5. Coordinator verifies challenge answer
6. Coordinator relays to server via encrypted UDP
7. Server sends encrypted answer + candidates
8. Coordinator relays to client via HTTPS
9. Direct WebRTC datachannel established

### Keepalive

- Server sends encrypted ping every ~30s
- Coordinator updates server timestamp
- No response needed (minimal overhead)

### Challenge Refresh

- Server sends encrypted heartbeat every ~10 minutes
- Contains new challenge and HMAC
- Coordinator verifies HMAC and updates challenge

## Encryption

### Binary Protocol

All UDP messages use binary protocol format to avoid fingerprinting:

```
[Version (1 byte)][Type (1 byte)][Payload (variable length)]
```

- **Version**: 0x01
- **Types**: 0x01=ECDH init, 0x02=ECDH response, 0x03=register, 0x04=ping, 0x05=heartbeat, 0x06=answer

### AES-CTR Encryption

Most UDP messages after registration use AES-256-CTR encryption:

- **Key**: Derived from expectedAnswer using SHA-256
- **IV**: Random 16 bytes, prepended to ciphertext
- **Format**: `[IV (16 bytes)][Ciphertext]`
- **Payload**: JSON message (encrypted in binary format)

**Exceptions**:
- **ECDH Init/Response**: Uses shared secret derived from ECDH
- **Ping**: No payload, no encryption (optimized for minimal overhead)

## Signatures

- **ECDSA**: P-256 curve, SHA-256 digest
- **HMAC**: SHA-256, using expectedAnswer as key
- **Timing-safe**: All comparisons use constant-time operations
